google-custom-metrics
=====================

Upload legacy Stackdriver custom metrics to Google Stackdriver.

If you don't know what this means, you probably don't need this package.  If you do,
this is a small HTTP library to upload arbitrary, application-defined metrics
previously sent to Stackdriver to the new Stackdriver.  Stats can be created on the
fly, they just show up in the dashboard like they used.
